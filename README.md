# Bridezilla, every bride's dream app 
This app was built using context API, React hooks, React, Ruby on RailsAPI 

The front-end will be found inside client

## Introduction
Bridezilla is an app that allows users to create an account and track every checklist they have to go through along with their bridal team before the big day. This app was just created to demo for Lyft's apprenticeship so it might not have the full functionality an app would have.  

## User Story:

- Authenticate a user with a username and password
- Authorize logged in users for specific actions
- Allow users to do full CRUD(create, read, update, delete)

## Setup

We have a code in place for a Rails API backend and a React frontend. To get set up, run:

```sh
bundle install
npm install --prefix client
```

You can run the Rails server with:

```sh
rails s
```

And you can run React in another terminal with:

```sh
npm start --prefix client
```


Hope you enjoy!
